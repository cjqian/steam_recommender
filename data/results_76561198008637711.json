Opposing teams are pitted against each other to capture and hold strategic points in order to attack and destroy the enemy power core.

Flying and driving machines take combatants to the frontline and gigantic mobile battle stations serve as a platform from which to launch devastating attacks. <br>\t\t\t\t\t</li><li><strong>Vehicles</strong> - Rev-up and ride out in an array of land-, air-, and space-based vehicles that play critical roles in a successful combat strategy in Assault and Onslaught.

It lets you see how all the security devices in a level are wired up, and then you can just click and drag with the mouse to wire them differently.
